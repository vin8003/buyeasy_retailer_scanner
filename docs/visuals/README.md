# Visuals

This folder holds illustrative diagrams and screenshots for the knowledge base. **Files are in Git.** Markdown must use repository-relative paths (for example `visuals/architecture-overview.jpg` from `docs/02-ARCHITECTURE.md`, or `../visuals/…` from `docs/07-KEY-FLOWS/`).

Do not make important information exist only inside an image. Every important visual has a textual explanation (and Mermaid where it helps).

## Guidelines

- Prefer Mermaid when the diagram can live as code.
- Screenshots and wireframes must never contain secrets, real customer data, tokens, or private business information.
- GitBook must not be the only way to see these files.
