# OrderEasy / BuyEasy Platform – Knowledge Base Index

This is the central knowledge base for the entire multi-repository project.

It is designed for both humans and AI agents. **Canonical copy is this Git tree** — see [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md). GitBook is optional presentation.

## User wiki (start here for retailers & customers)

The **[`wiki/`](../wiki/README.md)** folder is the plain-language help centre — getting started, customer guide, retailer guide, scanner, FAQ, and end-to-end project map. Use [`wiki/SUMMARY.md`](../wiki/SUMMARY.md) as the table of contents. Last reviewed **18 Sep 2026** — see [What’s new](../wiki/whats-new.md).

| Wiki section | Audience |

### Covered in wiki (user-facing)

- Setup / onboarding — [wiki/getting-started/](../wiki/getting-started/for-customers.md)

### Not written yet in `docs/` (do not invent technical content)

## Canonical Diagrams

All image files live in [`visuals/`](visuals/) and are referenced with **repository-relative** paths.

- System Architecture — [02-ARCHITECTURE.md](02-ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Order Status Lifecycle — [07-KEY-FLOWS/order-lifecycle.md](07-KEY-FLOWS/order-lifecycle.md)
- Inventory & Batch Logic — [07-KEY-FLOWS/inventory-and-batches.md](07-KEY-FLOWS/inventory-and-batches.md)
- Offer Calculation Engine — [07-KEY-FLOWS/offer-calculation.md](07-KEY-FLOWS/offer-calculation.md)
- Credit / Khata System — [07-KEY-FLOWS/credit-khata.md](07-KEY-FLOWS/credit-khata.md)
- Customer / retailer / scanner journeys — [03-USER-JOURNEYS.md](03-USER-JOURNEYS.md)

## Design Principles

- Text is primary. Diagrams support the text.
- Prefer Mermaid for machine-readable diagrams.
- Small, focused documents.
- Three layers: Human-readable explanation → Mermaid → Visuals.
- Every important visual has a textual explanation.
- Durable knowledge does not live only inside a Jira ticket or a GitBook page.
